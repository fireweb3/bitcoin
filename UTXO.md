## What is the UTXO Model?
An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is the amount of digital currency that remains after a cryptocurrency transaction. You can think of it as the change you receive after buying an item, but it is not a lower denomination of the currencyâ€”it is a transaction output in the database generated by the network to allow for non-exact change transactions.

## Understanding the UTXO Model
UTXO is a protocol for distributing the bits of data that cryptocurrency is made from and can be difficult to understand initially. A cryptocurrency network or developer sees UTXO much differently than a day-to-day cryptocurrency user does.

For example, imagine that 1 BTC is a bucket full of coins. Each coin represents a UTXO. If you purchase something from Bob for .5 BTC, the network will give Bob the entire bucket of coins and send back the .5 BTC you're owed in "change." You now have a UTXO worth .5 BTC that cannot be divided into smaller amounts.
